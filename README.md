# Banker-s-Algorithm
This C++ code is to implement the Banker's Algorithm including the Safety Algorithm and the Request Algorithm.
The user enters the Allocation and Maximum matrices and the available resources vector.
The user can enquiry if the system is in a safe state. 
The user can enquiry if a certain immediate request by one of the processes can be granted. 
The output is the Need matrix and a proper answer with yes or no to his enquiries showing the sequence of processes that will create safe state if yes and in case of the enquiry to an immediate request, the sequence is shown where the first process written in it is the process which is granted the request.
